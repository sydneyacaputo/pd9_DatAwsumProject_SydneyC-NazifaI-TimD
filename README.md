  GAME PLAY IS DONE IN THE TERMINAL 
How to Play: 
- Use any exposed aces to start a pile on which you will build up the remaining cards in that suit.
- Move any remaining cards around as you build rows of cards that are in descending order and alternating color (e.g., 10 of clubs, 9 of diamonds, 8 of spades, 7 of hearts, etc.).
- After clearing all face-up cards from a row, flip over the top face-down card.
- Continue to build the suit piles, beginning with the aces, and to rearrange the rows of descending cards, in order to free up all the cards that are face down in piles.
- Once a row is empty (with no more face-down cards), a new descending row can be started using a king.
- Whenever no more moves remain, turn over cards from the reserve deck, one at a time.
- When using cards from the deck, only the top card of the three can be played. Any time a card is played, the one underneath it is then fair game.
- Once all reserve cards have been turned over, the entire stack can be turned back face down and reused.


To win: 
- To win the game you must successfully free up all face-down cards and manage to build each of the suit piles all the way from ace to king.
