- make card class
- pile interface 
	- deck, suits, and ranks will all implement this interface 
- test the classes 
	- with test cases, make sure it works
- start the initial set up 
	maybe have as a 2D array where the user can indicate the row and column where they want to move it, 
add a method that if an ace is picked it will automatically go to the 4 suits
