**= very important, need to do
~~= done
##= needs testing and/or creation 

Timeline/ To Do List:
- make card class ~~
- pile interface ~~
	- drawpile
	- suitsort
	- numSort 
		- need to turn into a linked list ~~
- test the classes 
	- with test cases, make sure it works
	- NEED TO FIX RANKS FOR LINKED LIST  
- start the initial set up 
	maybe have as a 2D array where the user can indicate the row and column where they want to move it, 
add a method that if an ace is picked it will automatically go to the 4 suits

->user interaction
	- be able to see a grid type structure
	- enter the row, column of the card and the card/cards they want to move and then select the location that they want to move it to
	- if these moves are not valid they should get a message saying “invalid”
	- maybe begin the game with some rules?
	- move counter 



- SolitaireRunner
	- update() (display like a 2D array) 
	- deal() (to add cards to the NumSorted Piles)
	- turn() 
		- method to check for unflipped cards on the top of NumSorted

- finish the project

Add ons once finished
- how hard to make a timer
- processing
- hints 
-point value
- lose or win (no more moves)
